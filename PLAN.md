I have a Seeed Studio XIAO-nRF52840 module. I want to use it as a bluetooth to hid converter dongle. I also have a split Corne wireless keyboard which is paired with the computer through bluetooth by using a code (i needed to enter a pairing code).
At work, i am using Deskhop switching device (https://github.com/hrvach/deskhop). that device requires the keyboard and mouse to be connected from cable because it needs hid devices. 
I want to plug my seeed studio dongle into deskhop and be able to use my corne wireless keyboard with it.
